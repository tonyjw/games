# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a minimal games repository that currently contains only a README file. The repository appears to be in its initial state with no established codebase, build system, or development workflow yet.

## Current State

- **Structure**: Single README file
- **No build system**: No package.json, Makefile, or other build configuration found
- **No dependencies**: No package managers or dependency files present
- **No testing framework**: No test runners or test files identified
- **No established architecture**: Repository is in initial setup phase

## Development Workflow

Since this repository is in its initial state, there are no established development commands or workflows. Future development will likely require:

1. Choosing a technology stack and framework
2. Setting up a build system
3. Establishing testing practices
4. Defining project structure and architecture

## Notes for Claude Code

- This repository is essentially empty and ready for initial project setup
- Any development work will require establishing fundamental project structure first
- Consider asking the user about their intended technology stack and project goals before proceeding with implementation
- No existing patterns or conventions to follow - this is a greenfield project
