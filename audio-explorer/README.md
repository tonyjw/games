# Audio Explorer

An interactive Web Audio API playground and game sound library for developers and audio enthusiasts.

## üéÆ How to Play

1. **Explore Preset Sounds**: Click any of the 24+ preset sound buttons to hear common game audio effects
2. **View Generated Code**: Check the browser console to see the exact code needed to recreate each sound
3. **Build Custom Sounds**: Use the Custom Sound Builder to experiment with:
   - Frequency (pitch) - 50Hz to 2000Hz
   - Duration (length) - 0.1 to 3 seconds  
   - Waveform (timbre) - Sine, Square, Triangle, Sawtooth
   - Volume - 0.1 to 1.0
4. **Copy Code**: Generated code appears in real-time and can be copied directly into your games
5. **Learn & Experiment**: Understand how Web Audio API parameters affect sound characteristics

### Musical Elements (6 sounds)
- C Major Scale, Major Chord, Arpeggio Up, Arpeggio Down, Bell Toll, Fanfare

All sounds use the standardized Web Audio API implementation for consistency across the game collection.

## üì± Controls

### Desktop
- **Mouse Click**: Play preset sounds and interact with controls
- **Slider Drag**: Adjust frequency, duration, and volume parameters
- **Dropdown Select**: Choose waveform types
- **Button Click**: Play custom sounds and navigate

### Mobile
- **Tap**: Play sounds and interact with all controls
- **Slider Touch**: Adjust parameters with touch-friendly controls
- **Scroll**: Browse different sound categories

## üèÜ Scoring

This is an educational tool rather than a competitive game. Success is measured by:
- Understanding of Web Audio API concepts
- Ability to create desired sound effects
- Knowledge gained about audio programming
- Code snippets successfully integrated into other projects

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Key Technologies
- **Web Audio API**: Core audio synthesis and playback
- **ES6+ JavaScript**: Modern async/await patterns for sound sequencing
- **CSS Grid & Flexbox**: Responsive layout system
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Theming and design consistency
- **Promise-based Audio**: Non-blocking sound generation

### Performance Optimizations
- Lazy audio context initialization (user interaction required)
- Efficient oscillator cleanup after sound completion
- Minimal DOM manipulation for real-time updates
- CSS hardware acceleration for smooth animations

### Accessibility Features
- High contrast color schemes
- Touch-friendly targets (44px minimum)
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatible semantic HTML
- Clear visual feedback for all interactions

### Educational Architecture
- Modular sound creation functions
- Commented code examples
- Progressive complexity (simple to advanced sounds)
- Real-time parameter visualization
- Console logging for debugging workflow
